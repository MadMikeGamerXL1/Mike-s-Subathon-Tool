# Mike's Subathon Tool
#WARNING: Spaghetti Code!
The source code for the Twitch tool that I've been working on since April 2016. This code needs cleaning, updating, and fixing, but there you go. I needed to get it uploaded before I forgot.

I know the code is total spaghetti, but it's the first project I've ever done in C#. In fact, the only language I've really ever done is JavaScript (which by the way I didn't even do much of, I created a simple Twitch chat bot using Node.JS, hardly covering the surface of JS). I now understand C# a lot more, but with Uni going on there isn't much time to re-write this. Maybe soon.
