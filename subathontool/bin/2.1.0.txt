+ Implemented a potential fix for icon not displaying, making it appear the program didn't open
+ New tabs for the homepage, replacing the previous tiles system
+ Added a new control bar at the top (may or may not stay, get your feedback in!)
+ Added a new status bar at the bottom.
+ Added a Pause/Resume Subathon button.
+ Added new contact options to quickly access Twitter, Discord, Knowledgebase, Email and the "About" window. Go to Help to access them
+ Added Word giveaway.
+ Added Bits store, along with Bits dictionaries.
+ Added Clips Tab. This will be worked on later.
+ Added Disconnect button to countdown, to abort any current IRC connections.
+ Added time converters to Countdown Settings - Now, you don't have to convert to seconds, you can enter the values you wish, and the Subathon Tool will convert them for you.
+ Added credits section to the Help tab - view the amazing support we've had. Is your name included? Mum, get the camera!
+ Added new security measures to ensure that your chat connection was successful. If it wasn't, it will attempt to reconnect.
+ Added crash detection behaviour - now, it'll prompt if you'd like to restore the previous countdown instead of resetting.
+ Added uptime memory behaviour - if you're detected offline, it will pause the uptime, instead of resetting it to 0 - useful for crashes.

+ Re-sub multiplier option now supports tiers.
