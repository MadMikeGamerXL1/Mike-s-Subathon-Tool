# Mike's Subathon Tool
The source code for the Twitch tool that I've been working on since April 2016. This code needs cleaning, updating, and fixing, but there you go. I needed to get it uploaded before I forgot.

I know the code is total spaghetti, but it's the first project I've ever done in C#. In fact, the only language I've really ever done is JavaScript.
